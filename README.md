# Tournament brackets

![Brackets preview](https://github.com/yurmalak/tourney-brackets/blob/storage/readme/bracket_preview.png?raw=true)

## Goals
- easily pluggable library with backend configurator and frontend widget(accessibility, mobile, etc);
- more bracket templates - currently there is only one (single elimination for 2^x players);
- option to pass custom component for specific game;
- probably make CMS Github-based to cut dependency on third-party db;
